*Structure in Nature is a Strategy for Design*
1980
by **Peter Pearce**

**According to Pierce** the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic forces to produce in nature is relatively understandable in the case of inanimate crystals, as interactions tend to be dominated by phenomena of psychology and geometry, the process is much more complex and evasive as the person examines its biological form and its structure. The division between intrinsic and extrinsic forces is not always clear and tends to be hierarchical. That is to say, if we put on a scale a force can be considered extrinsic, but in a larger context, the same force can also

become intrinsic. This hierarchical phenomenon exists for inanimate and animate structures. For example, a given molecular structure may constitute an intrinsic system of forces that controls the choices of possible crystalline cells by shaping them when they are in association with other cells, and the environment formed by contiguous cells is an extrinsic force that determines which can take the shape of the cell. The interaction of the extrinsic force with the intrinsic force thus forces the molecule and determines the shapes of the cells in a given order.

## Line + Kinetic and Op Art + movement

Sculpture, **Pénétrables**
**Jesus Rafael Soto**
1957
Venezuela

*In Jesus Rafael Soto's work, this interim perspective on the abstract object, or 'non-form', as a play of spaces and sensations, emphasizes the work of art as practice, as participatory intervention. Thus, the observer leaves his or her frontal place to be part of the experience of that same space. Perception, according to the same author, leaves (...) from the inside and not from the front: there are no spectators anymore: there are only participants.*

*The Pénétrables with its constant movement of the image from the movement of the spectator, translates a **kineticism** into the apparent mobility of a world: Soto's revision is adapted to the principle according to which, thanks to the twodimensionality of the planes, can transform the visual point of the eye that no longer addresses a single dominant point (...)*
