# Publish a project

There are a couple of ways to publish your work on the web. The recommended option is to upload it to [Github](http://github.com), the world's most popular code repository. It makes your work not just accessible from the web but brings more visibility to the project and allows other community members to contribute.

### Set up a Github account

Go to http://github.com and register a new account.

You will receive an e-mail with a confirmation link. Click the link, and you are ready to move to the next step.
  
### Make a copy of the example project

Go to https://github.com/designstem/fachwerk_example

Click **Use this template** button.

Next, pick a name for your project, for example, `my_example`. 

> Note that you can only use letters, numbers, and dashes. It is recommended to use lowercase letters. You can later change the project name if necessary.

### Configure the publishing of the project

By default, Github does not publish your project to the web. To enable it, click on the **Settings** tab first:

Scroll below, and you will find a **Github Pages** section.

In **Select source** selection choose **master branch**.

You now set your project to be published to the web.

> ***Important:*** Note that publishing will not start right away; you need to edit and save your content first.

### Edit and save your project

Go back to your project frontpage and click on **index.md** filename.

Next, click on the **pencil icon** to edit the file.

You now can freely edit the project contents.

> If you have edited your content in the integrated editor in the previous steps, you can copy and paste your content here.<br><br>On Windows, use <kbd>Ctrl + a</kbd>, then <kbd>Ctrl + c</kbd> to copy the integrated editor content<br><br>On Mac,use <kbd>⌘ + a</kbd>, then <kbd>⌘ + c</kbd> to copy the integrated editor content

When finished, click on **Commit changes**, it is the same as *saving* changes.

Note the textfield *Update index.md*.  It is the place to write down a quick note of what you changed in the project. It is useful when several people edit the same document but also helps *you* to keep track of the changes.

### We are live!

Your project is now published on the web under the following link:

> http://`yourusername`.github.io/`yourprojectname`

For example, when the `username` is **kristjanjansen**, and the `yourprojectname` is **my_example** the link will be

> http://kristjanjansen.github.io/my_example
