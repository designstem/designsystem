### Why not React?

Why not indeed. React [MDX ecosystem](https://github.com/mdx-js) and tools like [Observable](observablehq.com) have been a great inspiration for us.

Our goal of the framework is make it instantly usable for everybody with the minimal knowledge of HTML. VueJS templates offer this and mixed with latest Javascript features such as module imports it was a *natÃ¼rliche* choice for Fachwerk.
