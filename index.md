# <big><big>Love *Ordnung*?<br>Here is Fachwerk.</big></big>

<big><big>Web framework for creating interactive learning materials. Only the latest Chrome for now. Fachwerk is a part of <a ref="https://designstem.github.io/homepage">DesignSTEM</a> education initiative.</big></big>

# **1** Play

<big>Best way to get the glimpse what the framework offers is just try them out on this page. There are almost 50 components to try out - everything from 2D/3D graphics, user interaction, content creation and more</big>

# **2** Learn

<big>[Documentation](./docs) has still a long way to go but here are initial tutorials and code samples. They are all live-editable so you can make instant changes and explorations in code.</big>

# **3** Build

<big>Fachwerk is built on top of VueJS so to build more complex materials it is recommended to code it in Javascript, using some of the frameworks components, utilities and styling.</big>

### Why Vue? Why not React?

While development the framework we wondered about it many times. We are big fans on React [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js) ecosystem and tools like [Docz](https://www.docz.site) and [MDX-deck](https://jxnblk.com/mdx-deck/#0) have been a great inspiration for us.

It is all about DesignSTEM's target audience, the primary use case we have. Main goal of the framework is make it instantly usable for everybody with the minimal knowledge of HTML. Educators and hobbyist are just about to graduate from jQuery, so build steps and other heavy Javascript tooling is not an option.

VueJS offers this easy migration path, so it was a natural choice for Fachwerk.
