## 1. Play

Best way to get the glimpse what the framework offers to try to edit the code samples in this page.

But not only that: <var>this entire page is editable</var> and can be stored in your browser so you can make instant changes and explorations in code.

-

<a class="primary" @click.prevent="send('edit')"><f-edit-icon />&nbsp;Edit this page</a>

## 2. Learn

Our documentation offer helpful guides to get started. 

Also, there is a full editable reference to our **ðŸ“¦&nbsp;{{ get('componentCount') }}&nbsp;components**, covering everything from 2D/3D graphics, user interaction, comprehensive layouts, beautiful math and more.

## 3. Build

Fachwerk is modular and flexible: if the built-in content authoring experience is not enough, one can build a totally custom application importing our components, utilities and styling as needed.

Also, all the code is MIT-licenced and development process is fully open so please contribute!

### Who are making this?

Fachwerk is a part of [DesignSTEM](https://designstem.github.io/homepage) education initiative that creates immersive experiences for future learning. We are educators, teachers, designers and engineers from 10 countries around Europe: Estonia, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Slovenia, Greece, Portugal, England and Italy.

### Why not React?

Why not indeed. React [MDX ecosystem](https://github.com/mdx-js) and tools like [Observable](observablehq.com) have been a great inspiration for us.

Our goal of the framework is make it instantly usable for everybody with the minimal knowledge of HTML. VueJS templates offer this and mixed with latest Javascript features such as module imports it was a *natÃ¼rliche* choice for Fachwerk.
