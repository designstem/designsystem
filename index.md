{{ get('c') }}

<big><big>Prefer <button v-on:click="set('type',0)">Hexagons</button> over <button v-on:click="set('type',1)">Circles</button> ? Here is **VueJS** and **Markdown** based framework for creating interactive learning materials.</big></big>

<br>

## **1**Play

<big>Best way to get the glimpse what the framework offers to try to edit the contents of this page. Everything here is **‚úçüèæeditable** so you can make instant changes and explorations in code. </big>

<br>

## **2**Learn

<big>Our [documentation](./docs) contains helpful **üîÆguides</mark>** to get started and references to more than **üì¶{{ get('componentCount') }} components**, everything from 2D/3D graphics, user interaction, beautiful math and more. Again, edit away!</big>

<big><a href="./docs" class="primary">Explore the docs</a></big>

<br>

## **3**Build

<big>Fachwerk is modular and flexible: if the built-in content authoring experience is not enough, one can build a totally custom application importing our components, utilities and styling as needed.</big>

### Why not React?

We keep wondering as well. As big fans on React [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js) ecosystem and tools like [Observable](observablehq.com) those ideas have been a great inspiration for us.

Our goal of the framework is make it instantly usable for everybody with the minimal knowledge of HTML. VueJS offers this and mixed with latest Javascript features it was a *Nat√ºrliche* choice for Fachwerk.
