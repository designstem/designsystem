#### Notes

This concept is divided into three main sections:

1. Hands-on activity with the turntable to explore the meaning of frequency and movement.

2. Virtual learning object to elaborate and test how frequency can be presented as a form of sinusoidal wave and how frame rate affects our perception of movement. 

3. Creative work to combine art and motion on a turntable.
