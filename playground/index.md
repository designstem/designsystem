### Rods and cones.

Rods and cones contain different light-sensitive pigments which absorb light and undergo a chemical change (“bleaching”) which releases energy. This results in increased permeability of photoreceptor membranes to sodium ions.

Sodium ions diffuse into the photoreceptors, creating a generator potential. If a threshold level is reached, an action potential is created in a nearby bipolar neuron. This connects to neurons in the optic nerve which carry impulses to the brain.
