## Look for patterns

Answers this question and find some inspirational images to stimulate your brain:

1. How do you **define** a pattern?

2. How would you **describe** a pattern?

3. Find at least three **meaningful examples** of patterns from your daily life. Take pictures of them, make sketches, etc.

4. Find at least three patterns **from other cultures**.

5. And at last: what pattern defines **you**? Think about your daily habits.
