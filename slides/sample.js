Design a polyhedral shape bird nesting box and learn the geometry behind it

---

## The assignment

Design a nesting box for a bird

The design should be based on **polyhedral shape**

The material should have some thickness (wood, etc)

---

## Design problem

There are birds which rely heavily on human made nesting boxes.

1. Find out which birds are these
2. What kind of nesting boxes the birds need
3. Can designers solve other problems with similar design approach?

---

## Why polyhedral shape?

People suffering from natural disasters or war zones all over the world often need quick shelter. Some of the most efficient solutions for such constructions are based on polyhedral design.

## Key steps

1. Find a bird for which to build a nesting box
2. Sketch your ideas
3. Create prototype of nesting box using cardboard or paper
4. Build the nesting box from wood or similar materials

## “But how?”

you may ask...

Let's find out!

## Geometry behind the nesting box

For designing and building a solid polyhedral object you have to:

1. **simplify the polyhedral object into more basic geometrical objects**, such as polygons, triangles and pyramids

2. use geometry to **calculate correct dimensions and angles** of these “building blocks”

Get to know the regular polyhedral shapes

Find the polygons: the sides of a polyhedron

Find the triangles: the “building blocks” of polygons

## Let’s start with triangles!

Triangle is the basic element that polygons and polyhedra are made of.
So let’s see, what type of triangles there are and what kind of relations exist between triangle’s sides and angles, that we can use in our project.

## Polygon: made of triangles

> Polygons are geometrical shapes, that are for the **sides of regular polyhedra** and they itself are comprised of triangles. 

By the way, the equilateral triangle itself is the simplest regular polygon.

So, in order to build a polyhedra, let’s get first familiar with it’s sides – the polygons.

## Simplification of polygons 

Looking at these polygons below, how would you simplify the shapes to calculate angles and distances?

## Polyhedron: *made of polygons*

Polyhedra (polyhedrons) are comprised of polygons. 

There are 5 convex regular polyhedra, also known as platonic solids.

## Simplification of polyhedron

Looking at this polyhedron, how would you simplify it to calculate angles and distances?

(You can see, that the sides of a polyhedron are polygons)

(You can see, that the sides of a polyhedron are polygons, that are made of triangles)

## One more problem… material thickness

Once you start to build your nesting box, you may face another problem: since material has some **thickness**, you have to cut the edges at a certain angle, in order to fit the sides of a polygons together.

---

## Dihedral angle

The angle between two sides of a polygon is called the **dihedral angle**.
